His impulse and his readiness to react to the rich non-confonformist, playful, pranksterish environment in which he did it, led to the creation of Burning Man, regional burns and in turn to AfrikaBurn.

It is a place of peace, a quiet catch-up and slow-down spot that you can use to catch your breathe and replenish your energy. A sweet sunset spot, a half hidden hiatus. Stop by for a visit on your journey across the playa!\r\nThe Living Room will also host regular shadow puppet making sessions. Make your own shadow puppet to use in the Play at Shadows theatre next door! Puppets are easily cut out of cardboard and attached to a stick. Hold your shadow puppet against the shadow theatre screen to see its beautiful silhouette! Materials and tools and demonstrations will be provided during these sessions. Scheduled sessions will be announced on our noticeboards!",

Come and experience the fun of shadow play. Create evocative images, tell stories and make memories! You can make your own shadow puppets or just play with our readymade ones. No prior experience required, just a sense of fun and innovation! And if you want to be part of a scheduled performance, check out the notice board for information or visit us at the Living Room dome.\r\nTo play, simply explore the box of puppets behind the stage and choose your favourites (or make your own!) Crouch down behind the stage or hide in the wings so you can’t be seen! Hold the puppets by their stick and press them against the screen. Move them about, act out a story or just enjoy the effect of the shadows at play!",

      "field_prj_wtf_short_copy": "",
      "field_prj_wtf_long": "The Skeleton Leaf of Change 2018, directed by Kaira Watermeyer, is a land art installation built by a group of young female artists for AfrikaBurn, Working Title. The notion of creating a safe space by embodying feminine energy had the project conceptualized, designed and built by women as a leaf reduced to its skeleton veined state which is symbolic here, in transformation of growth and change of the self and the environment. Therefore, this sculpture is an acknowledgment of the ancestral presence of the desert and a way to give thanks to this immense inheritance. The artwork is an ode to mother nature and the sacred land where the piece came to life, the Tankwa Karoo National Park. \r\n\r\nThe project has an environmentally safe structure as it is completely constructed by wattle trees that were deforested for the purpose of making this artwork. Wattle is an invasive species that grows in abundance in South Africa, affecting the natural ecosystem and draining much needed water. The leaf was to be created with the consciousness of having minimal environmental effect, by mainly using wattle and eco string for the small details. The wattle trees were stripped and woven tight to form the whole amature. The anchor of the structure was also a wattle woven base that pegged and sunk into the ground to avoid using unnatural matter in order to keep the structure standing. The result was a strong skeleton of a large scale leaf, which perpetually evolved during the building process and transformed in what was seen as a ‘desert flower’. \r\n\r\nThe concept of the piece manifested into the symbolic strength of the sculpture, it grew and change occured. The gentle technique of weaving and knotting the geometric lace-like veins of the leaf brought a significant creational feminine energy to the project. This meditative process and attention to detail reflects the nurturing energy of earth as creator and/or mother, its patience reflected in the serene and perfectly balanced design of the natural world. It signifies its strength through its fragility, seen in the way it is exploited in the contemporary world. This diligent method of sculpting and the sculpture itself are a powerful metaphor for how we, as the greater collective of human kind, need to enhance the balance of our relationship with earth with respect and openness to the lessons it brings. The Skeleton Leaf of Change intensified the change within the balance of masculine and feminine tendencies faced during the process of its creation. \r\n\r\nDuring the AfrikaBurn; Working Title gathering , the project was approached to remain as part of the Tankwa Artscape land art garden to be maintained alongside other structures on the same land and so to lead as an example of nature art, eco building techniques and concept. Honored as a blessing to the land, the artwork did not burn, but remained as a reminder of strength in nature and women. This provoked one of the most beautiful open ceremonies that held a number of collaborations. An array of fire dancing and garments, a profoundly moving sound journey, a primal fire to share the flame with neighbouring burn Fine Balance, a set alight of a young girl’s Burning Heart artwork and a closing ceremony to a seven day water ritual. This site specific experience was the first ‘watering’ at AfrikaBurn and its heartfelt energy was an organic performance occuring while the sun set and the moon began to rise.   \r\n\r\nThe artwork is now to be featuring as part of AfrikaBurn; Emphemeropolis exhibit.",

This is a tribe of Dreamers! \r\n\r\nWe are a group of like-minded creatives, artists, designers, techies, burners, founders, digital nomads, philosophers (blockchain enthusiasts), community builders and techno lovers mainly from the startup and festival scene here in Berlin who love to come together periodically to create a shared experiences for all - irrespective of gender, age, skin colour or origin.  \r\n\r\nWe are planning to create an inclusive experimental space inspired by our favourite Berlin clubs. Our theme is part circus part magical world part open air, think psychedelic interactive art, dream catchers in the wind and an eye catching 'living Tree installation near our techno stage (still in design stage). Daytime will start late and chill but we will cook a big community brunch to Thursday to Saturday where anyone is welcome! And will be hosting some mid day yoga sessions which will then transition into ecstatic dance sunset session, as the night gets darker some of our friends have prepared a laser light show to project into the desert (or on to the roof on the tent) as a backdrop to our carefully curated lineup of Berlin techno DJs to take us a into the early morning. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute in any way or be part of the Dreamers camp we are very welcoming to everyone :)",

Quite obsessive about anything evolving and expressive – animal print, fur and bright colours; exotic concepts for beings with hearts made of metal.\r\nWe welcome you to free your inner robot hearts through facilitated mindfulness, deeper connections and human touch. Come sweat out your inner demons and dance off your rusty screws with us!. Loosen up, simmer down & join the fun. We’ve got quite a lot cooking for you in Tankwa Town, so come by our camp, check out our event announcements & for your own sake – don’t miss out!\r\nSee you at the Vagabonds camp– you’ll find us by the LED-dome sign!\r\nMassage Mornings (every morning 10-12ish):\r\nMuscular relaxation is key when exploring all day & dancing all night. Besides the fact that it promotes human connection, which we love, it also increases your blood circulation bringing more oxygen and nutrients into your body. Ready for another rave, anyone?\r\nSauna Session (every evening):\r\nFeeling chilly? What better way to wind down after an epic trip on the Playa than a releasing sauna session! Let your hair down. Drop your shoulders. Relax your jaw. Rinse out the dust from your pores with a 60ºC heat therapy. Bikram ain't got nothing on this one. Complete the experience with a calming massage and voilà – you’re good to go another day!\r\nHuman Connection Workshop (TBA):\r\nNo matter what we do, it all comes down to this in the end: what most people really want and need, is human connection.That’s what makes us happy. We will pair up random people from the community, and have them connecting on a deep level. We’ll use scientifically proven exercises from social psychology to create interpersonal closeness, all within a very short amount of time. We’ll then connect the learnings to the real world & look at how we can use these insights to establish connection with people in our own lives.\r\nCocoa Ceremony (TBA):\r\nFeeling the crash from yesterday’s fun fun fun? In need of a nourishing time out? Join us for a heart warming Cacao Ceremony & let go of yesterday’s pains & gains! Together, we’ll let go of any stress, anxiety or depression – opening our hearts, and giving ourselves some much needed self-love so that we can feel blissed out and loved up!\r\nMulti Rhythm Ecstatic Dance (TBA):\r\nRadically express yourself and surrender to a multi rhythmic flow of sound vibrations. No talking, just movement. Experience presence, movement, breathing, and connection with yourself.\r\nNaked Ice Bath (TBA):\r\nShrinkage alert! We will do a Wim Hof breathing technique and then take turns jumping in the ice bath. Ice baths have lots of health benefits and can be a refreshing way to reset your day and give yourself a boost of energy. Apart from the health benefits, ice baths are just super cool anyday.\r\nBreakfast Beat (TBA):\r\nSober up, grab a coffee & join us for some morning disco! Providing healthy mornings filled with love and movement. We welcome everyone to experience the dance floor filled with electronic music & happy dancing people – there really is no better way to start the day.",

Become an artist or a muse; consecrated or enchanted...\r\n\r\nInspired by the 1973 Alexandro Jodorowsky film, 'The Holy Mountain', this theme camp is a sanctuary and a stage, a journey and a destination. If you pass through the gateway, a comfortable chill space with couches, cushions and carpets awaits you, along with some supplies to express your creativity, and world music in the background. Everything that happens next is up to the mystery of time. You might be surprised, perhaps by yourself. \r\n\r\nYoga connects body and spirit on Tue / Thu / Sat 9-10am and The Holy Mountain movie night happens Wed 8-10pm. We'll serve tea (and maybe some treats) daily, when the time is right.\r\n\r\nThe elements of chemistry are many, but finite. So are the techniques of enlightenment. Do you want gold? Yes! You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold. \r\n\r\nCome find yourself at 5-ish and Buitekring.",

Look no further than camp brekfis rolls, where we have mastered the art of the burner breakfast roll to get those tastebuds cooking again. Every morning we whip out the grill and our factory line of chefs that received training all over the world (not really), and make the most delicious breakfast sandwiches you’ve tasted this side of the Karoo (bacon and egg rolls). We’re here to provide sustenance to as many burners as we can and make sure everyone has enough energy for a jol throughout the day! Besides the food, we also make sure our chill space on the binnekring is comfy, open-minded and inviting with maybe a tune or two livening it up a little!

At the end of the project, the videos will be combined to show the love, happiness, and positivity of these willing participants scattered throughout the world that have broken these walls of fear, hate, and misery; with the goal of being displayed for public view to inspire, lift, and promote participation in similar projects/ideas of love and positivity.

From the outside one can see and hear bits of the inside and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe center is here for you to relax, meditate, find your source, find yourself.

It is a space where creators of all ages are welcomed to spend time in.\r\n\r\nThe artwork wants you to feel at home, to feel at peace, to smile. The artwork wants to be burnt down. Just like the child wants to create once the cord is cut, the artwork wants you to reconnect to source, TO YOURSELF, and wants to motivate you in creating once it is gone, because you are here in this space, in this time in order to do. To do something which makes you feel good, happy, satisfied and proud of yourself. And I dare to believe that whatever makes you feel those feelings is something conducted with purely good intentions.

      "field_prj_wtf_long": "‘Heyoka’ is a Native American word meaning ‘sacred clown’ or ‘fool’. This term is apt because it describes the way Heyoka use light humorous energies to open people’s minds and to heal. They work almost by tricking or joking with people.\r\n\r\nThey understand that sometimes the only way shifts people’s thinking is to startle them out of it. They do this by showing them a completely different way of looking at things, often the complete opposite way.\r\n\r\nThe healing of a Heyoka is important, but they don’t take life too seriously. \r\nHeyoka empaths also behave as a mirror, reflecting other people’s behaviour back to them so others can see themselves in a new way and begin to heal.\r\nWhat do Heyokas do?\r\nIn Native American ceremonies, the Heyoka’s role would be to disrupt things in order to enable people to see things differently. This kind of empaths uses the energy of the sacred clown to open people’s eyes to new possibilities and different angles on a situation. They also have the ability to shift the energy of a group through their understanding of emotions.\r\n\r\nModern-day Heyoka Empaths will often say or do something to shift energy and change perceptions. This allows others to begin to see clearly and heal. This kind of empath doesn’t heal in a conventional way, with crystals, their hands or through spirits. Instead, they create the space for others to become more aware of how they are behaving and thus heal themselves.\r\n\r\nHeyoka empaths often heal through chaos and disruption. This is not always an easy or peaceful healing. However, it may be necessary for those completely stuck in a way of thinking that does not serve them.\r\n\r\nBecause Heyoka are empaths, they understand the emotions of others and are, therefore, able to provide the healing method suited to the individual’s needs. They might not heal someone completely all at once, however, he or she can lead someone through the next step on their journey to wholeness.\r\n\r\nThe aim of our tribe is to \"heal\" & provide peace of mind to the burners who want to go through the experience. By different practices : energetic massages, shiatsu, collective meditation, ayurvedic medicine, dragon dance, yin yoga, breath work...\r\nThese activities will help sharpening one’s reflections and self-communication and self expression. \r\nThe expression of mind, body and spirit as a proclamation of our freedom from conditioning and rigid thinking.",

She often works with community groups to develop ideas that reflect the identity of the users, drawing on shared cultural history and heritage of the local area. These collaborations have resulted in some strong permanent installations in hospitals, schools and libraries.\r\n\r\nThe eclectic breadth of her work includes the Temple of Agape London 2014, Mirar y ver a camera obscura in Mexico City 2015, Superstucture Sweden 2015, Wide Open Austria 2016, Super Hot structure Romania 2017, Joy and Peace two installations London, UK 2017, Power — permanent installation, Battersea Power Station London, UK 2017 and Surrender to its Warm Embrace installation Las Vegas 2017.

This installation is permanently installed on on private land in Washington. It is an exploration of potential energy, transformation, an man’s power in shaping reality.\r\n\r\nBurning Man 2018 – Swoon\r\nAt Burning Man 2018 I founded a placed theme came called Swoon. It was mostly accurately described as a continual orgy without the expectation of penetration.\r\n\r\nAfrikaBurn 2018 – Urge\r\nUrge was a piece produced for AfrikaBurn 2018. It was conceived to be be a place of intimacy, escape, and quiet in the deepest depths of the Tankwa Town playa.\r\n \r\nBurning Man 2017 – Shibari Sanctuary\r\nI received an honorarium to lead a project to build a 6m tall climbable mountain using 17km of rope all hand tied in a geometric web based pattern. It had a womb like interior that could be entered where we hosted 3 performance nights with some of the best riggers from around the world. We burnt the 17km of rope on Friday night. I was the artist, project manager, camp manager, and literally everything lead for this project. I lead a team of 30 incredible people from Japan, America, Australia, Spain and Isreal many of whom only have very basic english skills and had never been to Burning Man before.\r\n\r\nDaliah's Shanghai 2017 – WOMB\r\nThis was a decretive installation in Shanghai for a party. It involved 2000m of rope and 20 florescent bulbs to create a space filled with light and warmth. I did a performance where I ted a model into the installation so she hung in space above the crowd. The performance was to showcase the beauty of the model and focus all attention onto her birth into reality.\r\n\r\nMidburn 2017 – Bound to Complexity\r\nThis was built as a test for Shibari Sanctuary at Burning Man. It was a tent like structure out of rope just big enough to surround a mattress. Mirrors hung from the rope to offer the visitors a moment of self reflection and expand the space. At night it was filled with red light. While I originally thought it would be a place to share Kinbaku with Isreal it quickly became clear it was something else. This installation was a magical much needed space that felt warm and safe and where many Midburn's found intimacy together. Over 100 people had sex inside it out in Midburn's deep playa.\r\n\r\nTel Aviv 2017 - Beit Kandinof\r\nIn an ancient arabic street turned venue I created to me what felt perfect in Israel. A compression and focused intensity. Again involving rope mirrors and light. Here I also hosted performances suspending models in front of this focused backdrop.\r\n\r\nContinued at www.benjaminlangholz.com",

Some days a relaxing vibe to chilled beats in the shade, the next a desert  funk party.\r\n\r\nWe will provide a shaded and carpeted area where our drinks and music offerings can be enjoyed out of the scorching sun. As the sun sets, the party will only be beginning, we will be open both noon and evening to be enjoyed by all. Some days a DJ, other days open mic and everything else in between (we're a talented bunch remember). \r\n\r\nWe'll have other exciting/random/loving gifts 'whenever-ish' and will encourage our new friends to come and go as they please! We are really looking forward to taking our participation to the next level.\r\n\r\nWabi Sabi will come into being with our community on Monday and dissolve at the stroke of midnight Sunday.\r\n\r\nExpect music and drinks all week from noon-ish, and whatever else we feel like, keep an eye on the blackboard.\r\n\r\nPlease pop in if you'd like to DJ or gift some music! :)",

But only when the darkness sets in, its light show will it create a temporary space for people to gather, gaze, exchange, contemplate, and reflect. The nine rays are individually illuminated by a computer controlled light show designed so that the light pulsates in sine-waves that are ever randomized, ensuring a non-recurring pattern in the light pulsation.\r\nNo two moments are ever the same.",

This is the story of Lobo – part wolf, part machine ...\r\n\r\nYear 2097\r\n     After the apocalypse mankind was wiped out, and only a few survived. The machines had upset the balance and a cold fog surrounded the earth. What was left was barren wasteland and scattered fragments of technology – a parasite draining the soil of all remaining resources. The moon had moved closer to the earth and a new anarchy existed between man and animal. \r\n\r\nGravity had shifted and the lunar cycles empowered the wolves. They became our loyal protectors – but for only those of pure spirit – the Tribe. In the name of their future, the Tribe built Lobo in a quest to restore the equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWith relentless spirit they created him - an all-sensory beast of the dust. Part machine, part wolf, with sound and light for weapons, instinct his guiding force and beauty his charm, Lobo roams the dessert and summons the spirit of the Tribe to raise the moon every night, and restore the balance the machines destroyed. Lobo lays down his head when the moon fades, but as he rises so does the Tribe ……. for the only thing that powers Lobo, is the spirit of the Tribe. \r\n\r\nAnd so Lobo moves with stealth-like precision along the dust-covered plains of Africa, in search of nothing ….. but the moment. Nothing could stop him, no traps, no forces of nature ... but with exception of his delicate heart. And so he offered his heart to the Tribe, to be protected in return for their own protection by that of the wolf.\r\n\r\n Year 2015 (9th Afrikaburn) was Lobo’s introduction to the playa. The theme: “The Gift”\r\n\r\nLobo Lives - \r\nLobo Loves -\r\nLobo Listens -",

Home of the famous Ethiopian coffee pot serving freshly roasted Arabica coffee beans since 2013. \r\n\r\nOrganically we have developed from   1 coffee pot to a funky Bedouin style art cafe housed in a Nomadic tent styled and pimped burner style  with materials , fractals , fairy lights reinforcing your nomadic desert experience . \r\n\r\nComfort is paramount and scarce at the burn , so  we offer you a  carpeted lounge with inflatable couches . We seat around 100 people and it takes roughly 40 minutes to work your way through our brews. We open at ‘FUCK HOT’ around 12-00, \r\n\r\nWe first serve the Pineapple ginger rooibos to clear the thirst . followed by the Moroccan mint  ,  poured from a thin spout to aerate  the tea . Finally we serve the Chai and Coffee .\r\n\r\nIn order to abide by LNT , we are introducing a round oven on steel tripod legs  where we will make our sacred ceremonials fire to brew our coffee and teas  . \r\n\r\nOur Coffee Beans are freshly roasted a few days before and our Coffee Maister bews a special Burn blend of Arabica coffee in Ethiopian coffee pots. Our Chai  Maister, a second generation Chai Wala , brews the finest Chai on the Playa by far . \r\nExpect to snack on fruit , biscuits and popcorn. \r\n\r\nOur resident Music Maister and his team of troubadours, bring our Café alive all afternoon. The sound of burn music magic is heard far from the door. Muso’s join the jam all afternoon. Our Music Maister has a nose to sniff out a crew of impromptu merry music makers. From around 14-00 the troubadour’s and their band of jammers get going all afternoon\r\n\r\nIts the last pot of coffee and the end of the day that signals the end of another great day at Fractal Chill , we close around ‘OK’ , around 17-00 .\r\n\r\nIf you are in fortune , then u may just be treated to a spontaneous DJ, set that will carry on through sunset into the night. \r\n\r\nNamaste !!!",
