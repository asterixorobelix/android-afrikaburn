# android-afrikaburn

[AfrikaBurn](https://www.afrikaburn.com/) is a community of participants who come together to create art, burning structures, costume, performance, theme camps, music, mutant vehicles and much, much more. All of this is created through the volunteer culture of the citizens of Tankwa Town in the Karoo once a year. It is roughly based on the [Burning Man](https://burningman.org/) event in the USA.

It kinda looks like this:
